- title: "Combining citizen science and deep learning to amplify expertise in neuroimaging"
  image: braindr.jpg
  description: "Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist. In Braindr, expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC = 0.99)."

  image: cloudknot.png
  description: "In the quest to minimize time-to-first-result, many computational scientists are turning to cloud-based distributed computing with commercial vendors like Amazon to run their computational workloads. Yet cloud computing remains inaccessible to many researchers. Cloudknot takes as input a Python function, Dockerizes it for use in an Amazon ECS instance, and creates all the necessary AWS Batch constituent resources to submit jobs. You can then use cloudknot to submit and view jobs for a range of inputs."

- title: "A browser-based tool for visualization and analysis of diffusion MRI data"
  image: afqbrowser.png
  description: "Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is important, it is not always clear how to share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we report a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is portable—it runs in any web-browser—it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of the dataset (anatomy, diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts."

- title: "Hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration."
  image: hackweeks.jpg
  description: "As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science."
