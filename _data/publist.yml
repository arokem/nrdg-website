  description: Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist. In Braindr, expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC = 0.99).

  description: "In the quest to minimize time-to-first-result, many computational scientists are turning to cloud-based distributed computing with commercial vendors like Amazon to run their computational workloads. Yet cloud computing remains inaccessible to many researchers. Cloudknot takes as input a Python function, Dockerizes it for use in an Amazon ECS instance, and creates all the necessary AWS Batch constituent resources to submit jobs. You can then use cloudknot to submit and view jobs for a range of inputs."
