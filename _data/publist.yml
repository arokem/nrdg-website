- title: "The benefits of prefetching for large-scale cloud-based neuroimaging analysis workflows"
  description: "To support the growing demands of neuroscience applications, researchers are transitioning to cloud computing for its scalable, robust and elastic infrastructure. Nevertheless, large datasets residing in object stores may result in significant data transfer overheads during workflow execution. Prefetching, a method to mitigate the cost of reading in mixed workloads, masks data transfer costs within processing time of prior tasks. We present an implementation of “Rolling Prefetch”, a Python library that implements a particular form of prefetching from AWS S3 object store, and we quantify its benefits. Rolling Prefetch extends S3Fs, a Python library exposing AWS S3 functionality via a file object, to add prefetch capabilities. In measured analysis performance of a 500 GB brain connectivity dataset stored on S3, we found that prefetching provides significant speed-ups of up to 1.86 ×, even in applications consisting entirely of data loading. The observed speed-up values are consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of prefetching for scientific data processing on cloud infrastructures and provide an implementation applicable to various application domains."

- title: "An open, analysis-ready, and quality controlled resource for pediatric brain white-matter research"
  image: hbn-pod2-sankey.png
  description: "We created resources to facilitate research on the role of human brain microstructure in the development of mental health disorders, based on openly-available diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study. First, we curated the HBN dMRI data (N=2747) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure and preprocessed it according to best-practices, including denoising and correcting for motion effects, susceptibility-related distortions, and eddy currents. Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI, and we provide automated quality control (QC) scores for every scan, as part of the data release. To scale QC to this large dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC = 0.947). A further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this work both delivers a resource for transdiagnostic research in brain connectivity and pediatric mental health and serves as a novel tool for automated QC of large datasets."

- title: "Automated detection of glaucoma with interpretable machine learning using clinical data and multi-modal retinal images"
  image: interpretable_glaucoma.jpg
  description: "Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, is a disease that damages the optic
nerve. Current machine learning (ML) approaches for glaucoma detection rely on
features such as retinal thickness maps; however, the high rate of segmentation
errors when creating these maps increase the likelihood of faulty diagnoses.
This paper proposes a new, comprehensive, and more accurate ML-based approach
for population-level glaucoma screening. Our contributions include: (1) a
multi-modal model built upon a large data set that includes demographic,
systemic and ocular data as well as raw image data taken from color fundus
photos (CFPs) and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, (2) model
interpretation to identify and explain data features that lead to accurate model
performance, and (3) model validation via comparison of model output with
clinician interpretation of CFPs. We also validated the model on a cohort that
was not diagnosed with glaucoma at the time of imaging but eventually received a
glaucoma diagnosis. Results show that our model is highly accurate (AUC 0.97)
and interpretable. It validated biological features known to be related to the
disease, such as age, intraocular pressure and optic disc morphology. Our model
also points to previously unknown or disputed features, such as pulmonary
capacity and retinal outer layers."

- title: "Evaluating the reliability of human brain white matter tractometry"
  image: pyAFQ.png
  description: "The validity of research results depends on the reliability of analysis methods. In recent years, there have been concerns about the validity of research that uses diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) to understand human brain white matter connections in vivo, in part based on reliability of the analysis methods used in this field. We defined and assessed three dimensions of reliability in dMRI-based tractometry, an analysis technique that assesses the physical properties of white matter pathways: (1) reproducibility, (2) test-retest reliability and (3) robustness. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide software that automates tractometry (https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ). In measurements from the Human Connectome Project, as well as clinical-grade measurements, we find that tractometry has high test-retest reliability that is comparable to most standardized clinical assessment tools. We find that tractometry is also robust: showing high reliability with different choices of analysis algorithms. Taken together, our results suggest that tractometry is a reliable approach to analysis of white matter connections. The overall approach taken here both demonstrates the specific trustworthiness of tractometry analysis and outlines what researchers can do to demonstrate the reliability of computational analysis pipelines in neuroimaging."

- title: "Multidimensional analysis and detection of informative features in diffusion MRI measurements of human white matter"
  image: dMRI_group_structure.png
  description: "The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. In the present work, we developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties measured along all of the bundles, and selects informative features by enforcing sparsity, not only at the level of individual bundles, but also across the entire set of bundles and all of the measured tissue properties. The sparsity penalties for each of these constraints is identified using a nested cross-validation scheme that guards against over-fitting and simultaneously identifies the correct level of sparsity. SGL makes it possible to leverage the multivariate relationship between diffusion properties measured along multiple bundles to make accurate predictions of subject characteristics while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter for the characteristic of interest."

In Braindr, expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC = 0.99)."

  description: "Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is important, it is not always clear how to share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we report a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is portable—it runs in any web-browser—it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of the dataset (anatomy, diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts."

  description: "As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science."

- title: "A model of ganglion axon pathways accounts for percepts elicited by retinal implants"
  image: argus_shapes.jpeg
  description: "Degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration cause irreversible vision loss in more than 10 million people worldwide. Retinal prostheses, now implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, electrically stimulate surviving cells in order to evoke neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as visual percepts (‘phosphenes’). However, instead of seeing focal spots of light, current implant users perceive highly distorted phosphenes that vary in shape both across subjects and electrodes. We characterized these distortions by asking users of the Argus retinal prosthesis system (Second Sight Medical Products Inc.) to draw electrically elicited percepts on a touchscreen. Using ophthalmic fundus imaging and computational modeling, we show that elicited percepts can be accurately predicted by the topographic organization of optic nerve fiber bundles in each subject’s retina, successfully replicating visual percepts ranging from ‘blobs’ to oriented ‘streaks’ and ‘wedges’ depending on the retinal location of the stimulating electrode. This provides the first evidence that activation of passing axon fibers accounts for the rich repertoire of phosphene shape commonly reported in psychophysical experiments, which can severely distort the quality of the generated visual experience. Overall our findings argue for more detailed modeling of biological detail across neural engineering applications."

  image: pulse2percept.png
  description: "By 2020 roughly 20 million people worldwide will suffer from photoreceptor diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, and a variety of retinal sight restoration technologies are being developed to target these diseases. One technology, analogous to cochlear implants, uses a grid of electrodes to stimulate remaining retinal cells. Two brands of retinal prostheses are currently approved for implantation in patients with late stage photoreceptor disease. Clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision restored by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. To better understand the outcomes of this technology, we developed pulse2percept, an open-source Python implementation of a computational model that predicts the perceptual experience of retinal prosthesis patients across a wide range of implant configurations. A modular and extensible user interface exposes the different building blocks of the software, making it easy for users to simulate novel implants, stimuli, and retinal models. We hope that this library will contribute substantially to the field of medicine by providing a tool to accelerate the development of visual prostheses."
