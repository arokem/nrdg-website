- title: "Combining citizen science and deep learning to amplify expertise in neuroimaging"
  image: braindr.png
  description: Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist. In Braindr, expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC = 0.99).

  description: "In the quest to minimize time-to-first-result, many computational scientists are turning to cloud-based distributed computing with commercial vendors like Amazon to run their computational workloads. Yet cloud computing remains inaccessible to many researchers. Cloudknot takes as input a Python function, Dockerizes it for use in an Amazon ECS instance, and creates all the necessary AWS Batch constituent resources to submit jobs. You can then use cloudknot to submit and view jobs for a range of inputs."

- title: "A browser-based tool for visualization and analysis of diffusion MRI data"
  image: afqbrowser.png
  description: "Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is important, it is not always clear how to share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we report a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is portable—it runs in any web-browser—it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of the dataset (anatomy, diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts."
