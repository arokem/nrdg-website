- title: "Convolutional neural network-based classification of glaucoma using optic radiation tissue properties"
  image: glaucoma_or.png
  description: "Sensory changes due to aging or disease can impact brain tissue. This study aims to investigate the link between glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, and alterations in brain connections. We analyzed diffusion MRI measurements of white matter tissue in a large group, consisting of 905 glaucoma patients (aged 49-80) and 5292 healthy individuals (aged 45-80) from the UK Biobank. Confounds due to group differences were mitigated by matching a sub-sample of controls to glaucoma subjects. We compared classification of glaucoma using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) focusing on the optic radiations, which are the primary visual connection to the cortex, against those analyzing non-visual brain connections. As a control, we evaluated the performance of regularized linear regression models. We showed that CNNs using information from the optic radiations exhibited higher accuracy in classifying subjects with glaucoma when contrasted with CNNs relying on information from non-visual brain connections. Regularized linear regression models were also tested, and showed significantly weaker classification performance. Additionally, the CNN was unable to generalize to the classification of age-group or of age-related macular degeneration. Our findings indicate a distinct and potentially non-linear signature of glaucoma in the tissue properties of optic radiations. This study enhances our understanding of how glaucoma affects brain tissue and opens avenues for further research into how diseases that affect sensory input may also affect brain aging."

- title: "Tractometry of the Human Connectome Project: resources and insights"
  image: hcp_tractometry.jpeg
  description: "The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has become a keystone dataset in human neuroscience, with a plethora of important applications in advancing brain imaging methods and an understanding of the human brain. We focused on tractometry of HCP diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. We used an open-source software library (pyAFQ; https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ) to perform probabilistic tractography and delineate the major white matter pathways in the HCP subjects that have a complete dMRI acquisition (n = 1,041). We used diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) to model white matter microstructure in each voxel of the white matter, and extracted tract profiles of DKI-derived tissue properties along the length of the tracts. We explored the empirical properties of the data: first, we assessed the heritability of DKI tissue properties using the known genetic linkage of the large number of twin pairs sampled in HCP. Second, we tested the ability of tractometry to serve as the basis for predictive models of individual characteristics (e.g., age, crystallized/fluid intelligence, reading ability, etc.), compared to local connectome features. To facilitate the exploration of the dataset we created a new web-based visualization tool and use this tool to visualize the data in the HCP tractometry dataset. Finally, we used the HCP dataset as a test-bed for a new technological innovation: the TRX file-format for representation of dMRI-based streamlines. We released the processing outputs and tract profiles as a publicly available data resource through the AWS Open Data program's Open Neurodata repository. We found heritability as high as 0.9 for DKI-based metrics in some brain pathways. We also found that tractometry extracts as much useful information about individual differences as the local connectome method. We released a new web-based visualization tool for tractometry—“Tractoscope” (https://nrdg.github.io/tractoscope). We found that the TRX files require considerably less disk space-a crucial attribute for large datasets like HCP. In addition, TRX incorporates a specification for grouping streamlines, further simplifying tractometry analysis."

- title: "Human white matter myelinates faster in utero than ex utero"
  image: baby_brains.png
  description: "The formation of myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers, is critical for healthy brain function. A fundamental open question is what impact being born has on myelin growth. To address this, we evaluated a large (n=300) cross-sectional sample of newborns from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). First, we developed new software for the automated identification of 20 white matter bundles in individuals that is well-suited for large samples. Next, we fit linear models that quantify how T1w/T2w (a myelin-sensitive imaging contrast) changes over time at each point along the bundles. We found faster growth of T1w/T2w along the lengths of all bundles before birth than right after birth. Further, in a separate longitudinal sample of preterm infants (N=34), we found lower T1w/T2w than in full-term peers measured at the same age. By applying the linear models fit on the cross-section sample to the longitudinal sample of preterm infants, we find that their delay in T1w/T2w growth is well explained by the amount of time they spent developing in utero and ex utero. These results suggest that white matter myelinates faster in utero than ex utero . The reduced rate of myelin growth after birth, in turn, explains lower myelin content in individuals born preterm, and could account for long-term cognitive, neurological, and developmental consequences of preterm birth. We hypothesize that closely matching the environment of infants born preterm to what they would have experienced in the womb may reduce delays in myelin growth and hence improve developmental outcomes."

  image: retino_or.png
  description: "The neural pathways that carry information from the foveal, macular, and peripheral visual fields have distinct biological properties. The optic radiations (OR) carry foveal and peripheral information from the thalamus to the primary visual cortex (V1) through adjacent but separate pathways in the white matter. Here, we perform white matter tractometry using pyAFQ on a large sample of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from subjects with healthy vision in the U.K. Biobank dataset (UKBB; N = 5,382; age 45–81). We use pyAFQ to characterize white matter tissue properties in parts of the OR that transmit information about the foveal, macular, and peripheral visual fields, and to characterize the changes in these tissue properties with age. We find that (1) independent of age there is higher fractional anisotropy, lower mean diffusivity, and higher mean kurtosis in the foveal and macular OR than in peripheral OR, consistent with denser, more organized nerve fiber populations in foveal/parafoveal pathways, and (2) age is associated with increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy and kurtosis, consistent with decreased density and tissue organization with aging. However, anisotropy in foveal OR decreases faster with age than in peripheral OR, while diffusivity increases faster in peripheral OR, suggesting foveal/peri-foveal OR and peripheral OR differ in how they age."

- title: "Incremental improvements in tractometry-based brain-age modeling with deep learning"
  description: "Multivariate measurements of human brain white matter (WM) with diffusion MRI (dMRI) provide information about the role of WM in a variety of cognitive functions and in brain health. Statistical models take advantage of the regularities in these data to make inferences about individual differences. For example, dMRI data provide the basis for accurate brain-age models – models that predict the chronological age of participants from WM tissue properties. Deep learning (DL) models are powerful machine learning models, which have been shown to provide benefits in many multivariate analysis settings. We investigated whether DL would provide substantial improvements for brain-age models based on dMRI measurements of WM in a large sample of children and adolescents. We found that some DL models fit the data better than a linear baseline, but the differences are small. In particular, recurrent neural network architectures provide up to ∼6% improvement in accuracy. This suggests that information about WM development is mostly accessible with linear models, and does not require the additional invariance and non-linearity offered by DL models. However, in some applications this incremental improvement may prove critical. We provide open-source software that fits DL models to dMRI data (https://yeatmanlab.github.io/AFQ-Insight)."

  description: "To support the growing demands of neuroscience applications, researchers are transitioning to cloud computing for its scalable, robust and elastic infrastructure. Nevertheless, large datasets residing in object stores may result in significant data transfer overheads during workflow execution. Prefetching, a method to mitigate the cost of reading in mixed workloads, masks data transfer costs within processing time of prior tasks. We present an implementation of “Rolling Prefetch”, a Python library that implements a particular form of prefetching from AWS S3 object store, and we quantify its benefits. Rolling Prefetch extends S3Fs, a Python library exposing AWS S3 functionality via a file object, to add prefetch capabilities. In measured analysis performance of a 500 GB brain connectivity dataset stored on S3, we found that prefetching provides significant speed-ups of up to 1.86 ×, even in applications consisting entirely of data loading. The observed speed-up values are consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of prefetching for scientific data processing on cloud infrastructures and provide an implementation applicable to various application domains."

  image: hbn_pod2_sankey.png
  description: "We created resources to facilitate research on the role of human brain microstructure in the development of mental health disorders, based on openly-available diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study. First, we curated the HBN dMRI data (N=2,747) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure and preprocessed it according to best-practices, including denoising and correcting for motion effects, susceptibility-related distortions, and eddy currents. Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI, and we provide automated quality control (QC) scores for every scan, as part of the data release. To scale QC to this large dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC = 0.947). A further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this work both delivers a resource for transdiagnostic research in brain connectivity and pediatric mental health and serves as a novel tool for automated QC of large datasets."

  image: interpretable_glaucoma.jpg
  description: "Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, is a disease that damages the optic
nerve. Current machine learning (ML) approaches for glaucoma detection rely on
features such as retinal thickness maps; however, the high rate of segmentation
errors when creating these maps increase the likelihood of faulty diagnoses.
This paper proposes a new, comprehensive, and more accurate ML-based approach
for population-level glaucoma screening. Our contributions include: (1) a
multi-modal model built upon a large data set that includes demographic,
systemic and ocular data as well as raw image data taken from color fundus
photos (CFPs) and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, (2) model
interpretation to identify and explain data features that lead to accurate model
performance, and (3) model validation via comparison of model output with
clinician interpretation of CFPs. We also validated the model on a cohort that
was not diagnosed with glaucoma at the time of imaging but eventually received a
glaucoma diagnosis. Results show that our model is highly accurate (AUC 0.97)
and interpretable. It validated biological features known to be related to the
disease, such as age, intraocular pressure and optic disc morphology. Our model
also points to previously unknown or disputed features, such as pulmonary
capacity and retinal outer layers."

  image: pyAFQ.png
  description: "The validity of research results depends on the reliability of analysis methods. In recent years, there have been concerns about the validity of research that uses diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) to understand human brain white matter connections in vivo, in part based on reliability of the analysis methods used in this field. We defined and assessed three dimensions of reliability in dMRI-based tractometry, an analysis technique that assesses the physical properties of white matter pathways: (1) reproducibility, (2) test-retest reliability and (3) robustness. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide software that automates tractometry (https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ). In measurements from the Human Connectome Project, as well as clinical-grade measurements, we find that tractometry has high test-retest reliability that is comparable to most standardized clinical assessment tools. We find that tractometry is also robust: showing high reliability with different choices of analysis algorithms. Taken together, our results suggest that tractometry is a reliable approach to analysis of white matter connections. The overall approach taken here both demonstrates the specific trustworthiness of tractometry analysis and outlines what researchers can do to demonstrate the reliability of computational analysis pipelines in neuroimaging."

  image: dMRI_group_structure.png
  description: "The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. In the present work, we developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties measured along all of the bundles, and selects informative features by enforcing sparsity, not only at the level of individual bundles, but also across the entire set of bundles and all of the measured tissue properties. The sparsity penalties for each of these constraints is identified using a nested cross-validation scheme that guards against over-fitting and simultaneously identifies the correct level of sparsity. SGL makes it possible to leverage the multivariate relationship between diffusion properties measured along multiple bundles to make accurate predictions of subject characteristics while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter for the characteristic of interest."

  image: argus_shapes.jpeg
  description: "Degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration cause irreversible vision loss in more than 10 million people worldwide. Retinal prostheses, now implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, electrically stimulate surviving cells in order to evoke neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as visual percepts (‘phosphenes’). However, instead of seeing focal spots of light, current implant users perceive highly distorted phosphenes that vary in shape both across subjects and electrodes. We characterized these distortions by asking users of the Argus retinal prosthesis system (Second Sight Medical Products Inc.) to draw electrically elicited percepts on a touchscreen. Using ophthalmic fundus imaging and computational modeling, we show that elicited percepts can be accurately predicted by the topographic organization of optic nerve fiber bundles in each subject’s retina, successfully replicating visual percepts ranging from ‘blobs’ to oriented ‘streaks’ and ‘wedges’ depending on the retinal location of the stimulating electrode. This provides the first evidence that activation of passing axon fibers accounts for the rich repertoire of phosphene shape commonly reported in psychophysical experiments, which can severely distort the quality of the generated visual experience. Overall our findings argue for more detailed modeling of biological detail across neural engineering applications."
